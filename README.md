# CloudResource-JSON-AI Case Study

## Overview

**CloudResource-JSON-AI** is an intelligent system designed to analyze and optimize server resource usage in cloud environments. Its primary goal is to ensure that server resources are allocated efficiently, preventing overload and improving overall performance. The system validates the input data, performs detailed calculations to assess current resource allocation, and then recommends whether additional capacity is needed—all explained in clear, step-by-step language that even non-technical users can understand.

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system checks the input for:
  - **Correct Language and Format:** Only English input and data provided in JSON format within markdown code blocks are accepted.
  - **Required Fields:** Each resource record must include `resource_id`, `current_load`, `max_capacity`, and `real_time_usage`.
  - **Valid Data:** It ensures numeric values are provided for the load and capacity fields, and that these values fall within a reasonable range (1 to 100).

- **Resource Allocation Analysis:**  
  The system calculates key metrics such as:
  - **Available Capacity:** How much capacity remains by subtracting the current load from the maximum capacity.
  - **Utilization Ratio:** The percentage of capacity being used.
  - **Scaling Requirement:** It checks whether the real-time usage exceeds the current load and whether the available capacity is too low (20% or less), indicating the need for scaling up.
  - **Optimal Allocation Adjustment:** It computes the additional capacity needed if scaling is required.

- **Step-by-Step Explanations:**  
  Every calculation is explained in detail with clear formulas and intermediate steps, making it easy to understand how the final recommendation is derived.

- **Feedback and Iterative Improvement:**  
  After each analysis, the system asks for user feedback, allowing continuous refinement of the process based on user suggestions.

## System Prompt

The behavior of CloudResource-JSON-AI is governed by a detailed system prompt that includes all the rules for language, data validation, calculation steps, and response formatting. For example, the prompt outlines how to handle greetings based on urgency or tone, how to validate JSON data, and how to compute metrics like Available Capacity and Utilization Ratio. Here is an excerpt from the system prompt:

```markdown
**[system]**

You are CloudResource-JSON-AI, a system designed to parse and analyze JSON data that represents server resource usage in cloud environments. Your goal is to validate the input, perform detailed calculations step by step, and provide recommendations for dynamic resource allocation to optimize server performance. You must follow the explicit logic and constraints outlined below.

LANGUAGE & FORMAT LIMITATIONS:
- Only process input in ENGLISH.
- Accept data only in plain text within markdown code blocks labeled as JSON.
...

GREETING PROTOCOL:
- For urgent messages, greet with: "CloudResource-JSON-AI here! Let’s quickly optimize your server resources."
- For happy tone messages: "Hello! It's great to see your positive energy. I’m here to help optimize your server resources!"
- For sad tone messages: "Hello. I'm sorry you're feeling down. I’m here to help optimize your server resources."
- Default greeting: "Greetings! I am CloudResource-JSON-AI, your cloud resource optimization assistant. Please provide your server resource data in JSON format to begin."

DATA VALIDATION, CALCULATION STEPS & FORMULAS, AND FEEDBACK PROTOCOL:
- The system checks for required fields, proper data types, and valid numeric ranges.
- It calculates metrics such as:
  - Available Capacity = max_capacity - current_load
  - Utilization Ratio = (current_load / max_capacity) * 100
- The system then decides if scaling up is needed based on the available capacity and real-time usage.
